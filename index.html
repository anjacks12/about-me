    <h3>A little background...</h3>
    <p class="background">Hello, my name is Angela and welcome to my webpage. Now that I've introduced myself, let me tell you a little about who I am. I'm a native Washingtonian and I grew up in Pierce County near Tacoma. I'm currently working full time in a medical lab while attending classes for 201 at Code Fellows. I've come to terms with the fact that my book-reading-Netflix-binge-watching days will have to be put on hold for a while, but it is all for a good cause!</p><br />

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p class="education">I graduated from Eastern Washington University with a degree in Chemistry, specializing in Forensic Science in 2006... that seems like such a long time ago... One of the coolest experiences I had while in school was doing an internship for the Washington State Patrol Crime Lab in the Toxicology department. Oddly enough, though my major was Forensic Science, I ended up in another completely different field.</p><br />

    <h3>Work</h3>
    <p class="job">I currently work as a Cytogenetic Technologist and if you didn't know what that is, don't worry, I didn't either until I started out as a trainee. I've been in Cytogenetics for about 14 years and have learned a lot about human genomics and all the things that can go wrong (genetically) with humans.

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p class="goals">I have actually been working in the medical laboratory field for about 20 years now (see the list below!). Phebotomy and working as a medical courier and dispatcher were great way to pay for school and learn more about the medical laboratory field. As much as I enjoy my job as a Cytogenetic Technologist, I'm thinking it may be time for a change... or at the very least, to learn a new skill. That was what brought me to Code Fellows. My goal at the moment is to complete 201, 301 and 401 and see what happens from there. Whatever it may be, I'm hoping in the end I just enjoy the journey.</p>
