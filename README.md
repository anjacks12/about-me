# LAB - 02

## About Me

This web page is an introduction to who I am. It includes a 7 question quiz. The first five asks the user y/n questions about if I like certain things and responds by either telling them they are correct or wrong. Question 6 gives the user four attempts to guess a number and the question 7 gives the user six attempts to guess an answer. Both answers for questions 6 and 7 are displayed for the user to see after the attempts have been made. The user is also prompted to enter their name in that give a personalized greeting and parting message at the end that includes the number of questions they answered correctly.

We worked together in lab 04 to add functions to our questions.

### Lab 02 Reflections

* I liked this lab because it was a nice way to ease into `if...else statements` and see how logical operators are used. I decided as a way to help me remember/learn, I tried to see if I could type out the html structure format myself but got stuck so I search for an example online. I did the same when writing the statements and also when incorporating the `.toLowerCase();` in the code but ended up having to refer to the class notes.
* I think for me, some extra practice on assigning variables when writing statements and functions is going to be needed, especially since next week I get the feeling we will be diving into functions.
* I wasn't sure how long this lab was going to take me, it ended up going quicker than I thought it would be, I'm hoping that will be par for the course but likely not, lol

### Learning Journal 02

* How do you see yourself planning and evaluating your learning?
  * As in above, I'm going to assess each class if there are things I still don't understand in the discussion or find myself getting stuck on as a way to guide me to what I need to spend some extra time on learning
* What details will you record and/or measure?
  * My plan is as I do or find ways to "test" myself, the amount of time it takes to solve a problem will be my gauge on how well I am learning or need to spend more time doing extra exercises
* How often will you evaluate what you want to learn?
  * I'm hoping it will be daily

### Lab 03 Reflections

* I'll admit, when I read the lab last night, I was worried... and rightly so after today! LOL. It was a tough lab. I didn't think I was going to be able to finish it today so I guess technically, it took shorter than I thought. I was glad to hear Ryan tell us in class that the next few weeks will be rough but after that, things will start to click into place. I'm going to keep that in the back of my mind for the next few weeks and try not to freak out when things start getting too complicated.
* I don't think I would have been able to finish the lab today without the help of Ryan and Taylor, the TA. Ryan helped me with setting up the conditionals to end my for loop, which wasn't even on my radar as something I could do. I think this is a good indication of something that I need to get more exposure to and work on more.
* I have a new found appreciation for loops after today. In lecture, they look easy to set up! I'm going to look forward to the day when it doesn't take me hours to write a for loop... and get it to work.

### Learning Journal 03

* I think my prior experiences before learning coding has taught me the value of hard work, patience, diligence, and utilizing resources. I've never been the top of any class and things don't naturally come easily for me but I think that really is a blessing in disguise! From past experiences, I've had to learn to not give up too quickly and not let the frustrations and disappointment of failure define the possibility of achieving a goal in the future. After today's lab, I think I'll get plenty more practice! Wow, that lab was *something* else! I really had to dig down deep and fight off a lot of negative self-talk, walk away from the computer and take breaks, and overcome my anxiety in asking classmates questions. The cool take-away lesson I've learned this past week is the value of others around you... your classmates, TAs and instructors. I think it is easy to feel the pressure of trying to figure things out yourself, but asking for help was key for me to be able to finish the lab today!
