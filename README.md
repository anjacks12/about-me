# LAB - 02

## About Me

This web page is an introduction to who I am. It includes a 7 question quiz. The first five asks the user y/n questions about if I like certain things and responds by either telling them they are correct or wrong. Question 6 gives the user four attempts to guess a number and the question 7 gives the user six attempts to guess an answer. Both answers for questions 6 and 7 are displayed for the user to see after the attempts have been made. The user is also prompted to enter their name in that give a personalized greeting and parting message at the end that includes the number of questions they answered correctly.

#### Collaborative Work

* On Lab 04 Andres and I worked together in lab 04 to add functions to our questions and include arrays in questions 1 through 5.

  * Andres was driver, [I was navigator](https://github.com/anjacks12/about-me/pull/2)

### Lab 02 Reflections

* I liked this lab because it was a nice way to ease into `if...else statements` and see how logical operators are used. I decided as a way to help me remember/learn, I tried to see if I could type out the html structure format myself but got stuck so I search for an example online. I did the same when writing the statements and also when incorporating the `.toLowerCase();` in the code but ended up having to refer to the class notes.
* I think for me, some extra practice on assigning variables when writing statements and functions is going to be needed, especially since next week I get the feeling we will be diving into functions.
* I wasn't sure how long this lab was going to take me, it ended up going quicker than I thought it would be, I'm hoping that will be par for the course but likely not, lol

### Learning Journal 02

* How do you see yourself planning and evaluating your learning?
  * As in above, I'm going to assess each class if there are things I still don't understand in the discussion or find myself getting stuck on as a way to guide me to what I need to spend some extra time on learning
* What details will you record and/or measure?
  * My plan is as I do or find ways to "test" myself, the amount of time it takes to solve a problem will be my gauge on how well I am learning or need to spend more time doing extra exercises
* How often will you evaluate what you want to learn?
  * I'm hoping it will be daily

### Lab 03 Reflections

* I'll admit, when I read the lab last night, I was worried... and rightly so after today! LOL. It was a tough lab. I didn't think I was going to be able to finish it today so I guess technically, it took shorter than I thought. I was glad to hear Ryan tell us in class that the next few weeks will be rough but after that, things will start to click into place. I'm going to keep that in the back of my mind for the next few weeks and try not to freak out when things start getting too complicated.
* I don't think I would have been able to finish the lab today without the help of Ryan and Taylor, the TA. Ryan helped me with setting up the conditionals to end my for loop, which wasn't even on my radar as something I could do. I think this is a good indication of something that I need to get more exposure to and work on more.
* I have a new found appreciation for loops after today. In lecture, they look easy to set up! I'm going to look forward to the day when it doesn't take me hours to write a for loop... and get it to work.

### Learning Journal 03

* I think my prior experiences before learning coding has taught me the value of hard work, patience, diligence, and utilizing resources. I've never been the top of any class and things don't naturally come easily for me but I think that really is a blessing in disguise! From past experiences, I've had to learn to not give up too quickly and not let the frustrations and disappointment of failure define the possibility of achieving a goal in the future. After today's lab, I think I'll get plenty more practice! Wow, that lab was *something* else! I really had to dig down deep and fight off a lot of negative self-talk, walk away from the computer and take breaks, and overcome my anxiety in asking classmates questions. The cool take-away lesson I've learned this past week is the value of others around you... your classmates, TAs and instructors. I think it is easy to feel the pressure of trying to figure things out yourself, but asking for help was key for me to be able to finish the lab today!

### Lab 04 Reflections

* This lab ended up being a lot more fun and rewarding than I thought it would be. I still feel like I'm not sure what I'm doing and was worried I was going to hold up my lab partner from completing the lab. I was fortunate enough to be paired with a partner who has a better understanding that I do. At first, I thought that it was going to be awkward and intimidating but thankfully he was a nice guy and was really helpful in explaining things and answering my questions.
* We started out with me driving and him being the navigator. I thought it was very helpful because I was able to observe how he went about setting up the code to include functions and set up array for questions 1 through 5. I would have had a tough time doing that on my own so having a partner was good way for me to expand my understanding of arrays and it was pretty cool!
* When it was time to swap roles, he was good about answering my questions and explaining things that I was still a little fuzzy about. I'd have to say that I ended up learning a lot. I hope this will be more of an incentive for me to not be afraid to approach teammates and ask them questions. I still feel like I don't have much to offer in return, but after today, I think having someone there to at least "hear you out" or being your sounding board may be a lot of help in its self.

### Learning Journal 04

* My motivation for learning is to:

1. Help me to keep my brain active and learn something new and completely different from what I already know
2. Challenge myself and do something that I thought I wouldn't or couldn't do before
3. To be productive and make better use of my time by learning a new skill
4. Get more exposure to technology so I can have a point of reference when tech related issues come up at work (aka have some sort of clue of what people are taking about when it comes to software ::grin::)
5. Finally, the ultimate motivation: To see if I really can change careers and find a job I love
